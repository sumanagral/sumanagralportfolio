<section style="max-width: 800px; margin: auto;">
  <h2 style="text-align: center; font-size: 24px;">Meet Suma Nagral: Engineer, Innovator, Pattern Seeker</h2>
  <h3 style="color: #555;">Welcome to the Crossroads of Code and Curiosity</h3>
  <p style="text-align: justify;">Hello, World! I'm Suma, your not-so-average software engineer weaving the fabric of tomorrow's tech landscape with threads of Python, Java, and a dash of JavaScript humor. Nestled somewhere between the structured paradigms of San Jose State University's Master's program and the creative chaos of my personal projects, I've found my coding zen. My journey isn’t just a series of compiled programs; it’s an epic saga of bugs conquered, features deployed, and the occasional coffee-fueled midnight eureka moment.</p>
  <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>The Saga Begins</strong><br>Born into a dynasty of computer scientists, you could say I was destined to speak in semicolons and loops. Yet, my path to becoming a software savant was anything but a straight line. It zigzagged through the realms of neuroscience, mountaineering, and even a philosophical quest or two. Imagine swapping climbing gear for cloud services, or philosophical debates for programming dilemmas – that's my kind of adventure.</p>
  <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Decoding Success, One Project at a Time</strong><br>My academic endeavors at San Jose State and Don Bosco Institute of Technology are like a finely tuned algorithm: complex, challenging, and ultimately rewarding. But don’t let the 3.81 GPA fool you; the real magic happened outside the classroom. From leading a backend overhaul at Kinai Infotech to mentoring minds as a Teaching Associate, my code has traveled across industries, impacting lives one git commit at a time.</p>
  <p class="hover-effect" style="text-align: justify;">As for skills, if there's a technology out there, chances are I've flirted with it. AWS? We're practically dating. React.js? It’s complicated. And when it comes to Docker and Kubernetes, let's just say things are getting pretty serious. My resume reads like a tech enthusiast's wishlist, but each skill is a chapter in my story, each project a badge of honor.</p>
  <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Not Just Code, But Community</strong><br>While I might be fluent in the language of machines, my heart beats for community. Whether teaching math to eager minds or demystifying technology for the less privileged, I've learned that the most powerful code is the one that brings us together. Remember, behind every anonymous username is a human heart, a reminder that in our digital world, empathy is the most underrated plugin.</p>
  <p class="project-highlight" style="text-align: justify;">You're here because, like me, you believe in the power of technology to transform, transcend, and occasionally, troubleshoot our way to a better tomorrow.</p>
  <p style="text-align: center; font-size: 18px; margin-top: 30px;">Let’s build something extraordinary together. Or at the very least, let's make the bugs entertaining.</p>
