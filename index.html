<section style="padding: 5px;">
  <h1 style="text-align: center;">Welcome to Suma's Digital Nook</h1>

  <h2 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Where Curiosity Codes the Future</strong></h2>
  <p style="text-align: justify; font-size: 18px;">
    <br>  Hi there! I'm <strong>Suma</strong>, and if you've stumbled upon this corner of the internet, you're in for a journey through the synapses of a software engineer's brain, one that's as fascinated by the intricacies of cloud computing as it is by the philosophical musings on existence.
  </p>

  <h3 style="color: #333;">The Road Less Coded</h3>
  <p style="text-align: justify; font-size: 18px;">
      Sure, my academic credentials from San Jose State University and University of Mumbai speak to a strong foundation in software engineering, evidenced by a solid 3.81 GPA. But the keystrokes of my career are more than just GPA and technical skills. They are about finding the extraordinary in the ordinary, be it in a line of code or a pattern in the chaos. This journey hasn't just been about the challenges and triumphs within academia; it's been a pursuit of magic outside the conventional classroom settings.
  </p>

  <h3 style="color: #333;">More Than Just Syntax</h3>
  <p style="text-align: justify; font-size: 18px;">
    As for skills, if there's a technology out there, chances are I've explored it. From tinkering with AWS to choreographing data flows in Python and Java, my toolkit is ready for problem-solving across any domain. React.js? It’s a bit of a puzzle. And when it comes to Docker and Kubernetes, let's just say we've formed a pretty solid bond. My journey from leading a backend overhaul at Kinai Infotech to fostering young minds as a Teaching Associate has been a profound lesson in the impact of technology—it's only as meaningful as the purpose it serves. Thus, I tend to approach problems with a holistic view. It’s about crafting solutions that resonate, not just function.  </p>

  <h3 style="color: #333;">A Byte of Humility</h3>
  <p style="text-align: justify; font-size: 18px;">
      While my resume might suggest I've got it all figured out, the truth is, my journey's been a series of debugged errors, learned lessons, and serendipitous detours. I've learned as much from the times my code refused to compile as from the moments of triumph. Whether it's leading a project or navigating the complexities of a new programming language, the real thrill lies in the learning curve.
  </p>

  <h3 style="color: #333;">Beyond the Screen</h3>
  <p style="text-align: justify; font-size: 18px;">
      My adventures beyond the IDE have been equally formative. Teaching math, engaging with community projects, and even that one time I thought I could outsmart a mountain (spoiler: the mountain won) have instilled in me a sense of responsibility to use my skills for the greater good. Technology, after all, is at its best when it brings people together, bridges gaps, and lights up faces with understanding and empowerment.
  </h3>

  <h2 style="text-align: center;"><strong> <br> So, Why Are You Really Here?</strong></h2>

  <p style="text-align: justify; font-size: 18px;">
    Maybe it's to explore the potential for collaboration, to share a laugh over a coding meme, or perhaps to find a solution to a tech puzzle that's been keeping you up at night. Whatever the reason, know that this isn't just a showcase of my professional journey; it's an invitation to connect, learn, and create together in this vast, digital universe.

                  <p class="blog-text">
                    SmartSuit is an Arduino-based wearable jacket that monitors various physiological and environmental parameters,
                     including air quality, ambient temperature, humidity, body temperature, 
                     SOS, heartbeat, and location. The hardware is linked to a website which 
                     features multiple user access levels, dynamic dashboards, and emergency 
                     alerts. Built utilizing HTML, CSS, JavaScript, MySQL, and PHP to visualize 
                     10+ metrics from multiple suits, allowing the basecamp to make swift and 
                     efficient decisions in critical situations.

                  <p class="blog-text">

                    The cloud storage application project was a full-stack endeavor designed 
                    to mimic Dropbox features, employing an array of technologies such as HTML,
                     CSS, JavaScript, PHP, and SQL. The infrastructure was further bolstered 
                     by AWS services, including S3 for data storage, EC2 for compute resources, 
                     RDS MySQL for relational database management, and CloudFront for efficient 
                     content delivery. High system availability was ensured through the strategic 
                     use of AWS Route 53 for DNS routing, Elastic Load Balancer for dispersing
                      incoming requests, and Auto-scaling Groups for dynamic workload management,
                       resulting in a 99.9% system uptime. Real-time system monitoring was 
                       instituted via AWS CloudWatch, augmented by Lambda and SNS for automated 
                       alerting. GitHub integration facilitated collaborative development and 
                       expedited issue resolution. A cost-benefit analysis was conducted to apply 
                       AWS S3 Lifecycle Management policies, achieving a 40% reduction in 
                       operational costs. Application security was fortified through the 
                       use of HTTPS, AWS IAM policies, and AES-256 encryption techniques.

                  <p class="blog-text">
                    The project was an in-depth exploration into the role of Natural Language Processing (NLP) in the analysis and generation of poetry, with a particular emphasis on the distinctive styles of William Blake and Robert Frost. It encompassed a thorough study, wherein a large corpus of poems was meticulously scraped and analyzed using state-of-the-art computational techniques for linguistic and thematic insights. A notable achievement of the project was the fine-tuning of the Mistral 7b Large Language Model, specifically tailored for poetry generation, which exhibited a high semantic similarity to the original poets' styles. To enhance the model's ability to generate contextually relevant poetry, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) was integrated via Weaviate. Moreover, the project included the development of Knowledge Graphs to associate poetic content with contemporary societal issues, highlighting the utility of NLP in literary analysis. A wide range of technologies, including Python, BeautifulSoup, TensorFlow, Weaviate, NetworkX, and various other NLP tools, were utilized. The project provided significant insights into the intricate interplay between language, creativity, and societal discourse, making a substantial contribution to the field of computational creativity.                  </p>
